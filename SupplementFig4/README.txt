This directory contains code to produce Supplementary 4 of the paper: 
"Microscopic fluctuations in power-grid frequency recordings at the 
sub-second scale"

The matlab scripts need to be executed in the following order:

TestZCforNoiseFiltTripletGenSamples --> Synthetic data generation
TestZCforNoiseFiltTripletGenFreq --> Estimation of frequencies
TestZCforNoiseFiltTripletAnalysis --> Analysis frequency data and plot 
generation
