This directory contains code to produce Figure 9 and Supplementary 
Figure 3 of the paper: "Microscopic fluctuations in power-grid frequency
recordings at the sub-second scale"

The matlab scripts need to be executed in the following order:

TestZCforFreqNoiseFIGgenSamples --> Synthetic data generation
TestZCforFreqNoiseFIGGenFreq --> Estimation of frequencies
TestZCforFreqNoiseFIGAnalysis --> Analysis frequency data and plot generation
